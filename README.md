# Methodolgy

The project involves extracting, collecting, and processing Swiggy restaurants' data and then utilizes data analysis techniques and machine learning modeling to predict the final output based on the preferences.

# Phases

Data Extraction: Gather comprehensive data from Swiggy, encompassing user interactions, orders, menus, and other relevant details.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Process the extracted data to address inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, ensuring high data quality and reliability.

Recommendation Model: Develop a sophisticated recommendation model that suggests personalized food choices based on user preferences, historical data, and menu offerings.

Prediction Model: Create a predictive model that anticipates future food demand, helping optimize inventory management and delivery operations.

Web Application (Streamlit): Integrate the prediction and recommendation models into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit. Users can explore food options, receive recommendations, and visualize predictive insights.

Power BI Dashboard: Design an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators, sales trends, and user preferences, aiding decision-makers in strategic planning.

The first CSV contains data on restaurants, including columns such as restaurant ID, restaurant name, restaurant link, price for two people, ratings, and the cuisines they serve. This table provides an overview of the restaurants available on the food delivery platform.

The second CSV contains information on dishes offered by the restaurants. It includes columns such as restaurant ID, restaurant name, dishes, cuisines, and the price of each dish. This table provides detailed information about the specific dishes offered by each restaurant.
