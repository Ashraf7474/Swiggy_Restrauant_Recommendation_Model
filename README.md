# Swiggy_Restrauant_Recommendation_Model
# --Introduction--

As it becomes crucial for customers at a new location to find the appropriate restaurant based on their preferences so a recommendation model can be a handful for the customers to get what they want and also for the companies to the betterment of services for their further future growth.

# --Problem Aimed to Solve--

To develop a Swiggy restaurant recommender model which can predict the suitable restaurant, price for two, and dish name based on a budget price, cuisine, and location

# --Data Description--

EXCEL FILES: This folder contains 3 Excel files where a. swiggy_table1 has the link of the restaurant, name of the restaurant, cuisine, price for 2 customers, and rating of the restaurants in .csv format. b. swiggy_table2 has the dish price, total rating numbers, dish name, dish category, and name of the restaurants. c. finalized_swiggy_dataset has the combined two tables mentioned above and the final dashboard based on this.

Jupiter notebook files: This folder has 3 files where a. web_scrapping has the Jupiter files which were used to scrap the data from Swiggy(Bangaluru) b. ml2 file was used to clean the dataset after extraction and to convert the HTML restaurant details into CSV files. c. swiggy_model file contains the code to create an algorithm to predict the restaurant name, the price for two, and the dish name based on the budget price, cuisine, and location.

restaurant_recommender folder has the source code file which we used to show our model on the HTML webpage.

# --Methodolgy--

The project involves extracting, collecting, and processing Swiggy restaurants' data and then utilizes data analysis techniques and machine learning modeling to predict the final output based on the preferences.

# --Phases--

Data Extraction: Gather comprehensive data from Swiggy, encompassing user interactions, orders, menus, and other relevant details.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Process the extracted data to address inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, ensuring high data quality and reliability.

Recommendation Model: Develop a sophisticated recommendation model that suggests personalized food choices based on user preferences, historical data, and menu offerings.

Prediction Model: Create a predictive model that anticipates future food demand, helping optimize inventory management and delivery operations.

Web Application (Streamlit): Integrate the prediction and recommendation models into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit. Users can explore food options, receive recommendations, and visualize predictive insights.

Power BI Dashboard: Design an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators, sales trends, and user preferences, aiding decision-makers in strategic planning.
