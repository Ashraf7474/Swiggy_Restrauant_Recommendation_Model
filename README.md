# Methodolgy

The project involves extracting, collecting, and processing Swiggy restaurants' data and then utilizes data analysis techniques and machine learning modeling to predict the final output based on the preferences.

# Phases

Data Extraction: Gather comprehensive data from Swiggy, encompassing user interactions, orders, menus, and other relevant details.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Process the extracted data to address inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, ensuring high data quality and reliability.

Recommendation Model: Develop a sophisticated recommendation model that suggests personalized food choices based on user preferences, historical data, and menu offerings.

Prediction Model: Create a predictive model that anticipates future food demand, helping optimize inventory management and delivery operations.

Web Application (Streamlit): Integrate the prediction and recommendation models into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit. Users can explore food options, receive recommendations, and visualize predictive insights.

Power BI Dashboard: Design an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators, sales trends, and user preferences, aiding decision-makers in strategic planning.
